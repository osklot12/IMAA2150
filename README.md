# IMAA2150

_Mathematical methods 3 (IMAA2150)_ is a course in numerical analysis
and linear algebra at NTNU. This repository contains aquired mathematical
methods from that course, mostly out of my curiosity and enthusiasm for the
topic.

Each method is complete within its own class, but all of them are
called in dedicated functions inside `main.py` to demonstrate how
they can be used. The code might not be following all best 
practices as the focus is on the mathematics.
